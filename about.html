        Sons of Sol is a Denton jam band that utilizes the energy of live performances to fuel their music on its journey through space and time.
        <br><br>
        Sons of Sol was born of the violent cataclysm of star death. As the stardust settled, it coalesced into humanity. Several thousands of years later, a group of cool people started making music. Their music is their story in sound. Genre has no meaning to Sons Of Sol, who have been known to delve into anything from Funk to Jazz to Reggae to Avant Garde and have been compared to bands such as Phish, Led Zeppelin, and The Grateful Dead. Because of this, Sons of Sol has a particular appetite for the energy of live audiences. They use this captured energy to steer their music and deliver a performance to be remembered every show. Luckily if you miss a performance Sons of Sol will make every show readily available to its listeners for free on soundlcloud.
